    <h2>Other Works</h2>
    <p>This section includes art work I have produced over the course of my life.  Mostly concept art.  In high school I was always drawing, but I wasn't always good about saving or protecting my works, so much of it was lost, but I have found a few pieces among old sketch books.  For about a year and a half I worked as a T-Shirt designer, so I've had a lot of practice designing from scratch and editing (Affinity designer and GIMP), but I no longer have access to that material.
