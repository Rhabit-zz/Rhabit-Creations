    <h2>Unbound TTRPG System</h2>
    <p>Unbound is a tactical, modular tabletop RPG system that emphasizes player agency, layered strategy, and meaningful consequences. It challenges players mechanically, tactically, and narratively while remaining fair and creatively open. (A few hundred pages of documentation can be provided on request, but is a work in progress)</p>

    <p><b>Core Concept:</b> <br>
    <b>Stats & Skills:</b> Every character starts with Rank 1 in all Stats (Body, Spirit, and Mind). Starting persona, based on Zodiacal signs or spirit animals, grant a free Rank 2 in one Stat. Skills cannot exceed their governing Stat rank. </p>

    <p><b>Resource Pools:</b> HP (Health), SP (Stamina), and MP (Mental) are used to track a characters current well being and ability to act in combat, and in social encounters.</p>

    <p><b>XP Economy:</b> A character starts with 16 XP to distribute across Stats and Skills.  Stat cost scale is multiplicative while skills are addative. (Stat rank 2 cost 2, rank 3 is 6, 4 is 12, 5 is 20, while skill rank 1 is 1, 2 is 2, 3 is 3, etc.)
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Action Points (AP):</b> Core resource for attacks, movement, and abilities. Scales with Spirit.
    </p>

    <p><b>Movement:</b> Cost 2 AP and 1 SP (unless modified by a skill) to move a character's full speed for the first time each round.  Multiple move actions in a round cost the same AP but addition SP (base SP times the move number: 2nd move is SP times 2, 3rd move is SP times 3).  Speed may be increased through Skills.
    </p>

    <p><b>Terrain:</b> Affects movement costs and targeting. 
    </p>

    <p><b>Attacks:</b> Cost AP plus HP, SP, or MP and are granted by Skills.  This allows for as much diversity as a player is willing to invest into.  Body adds to physical attacks, Mind adds to energy attacks (called affinities), while Spirit instead grants more AP.
    </p>

    <p><b>Defense Tokens (DT):</b> For one AP gain your highest stat value in Defense tokens.  Expend DT to Block, Dodge, or Deflect (each associated to a Stat) to defend against incoming attacks once per action.  Some skills will grant free DT instead of having to spend your AP to gain DT.
    </p>

    <p><b>Opposed Rolls:</b> Attackers roll a D6 per governing Stat Rank of the skill being used.  If the Defender has DT they make an opposing D6 per governing Stat roll of the appropriate defense type.  Subtract any defense rolls from the attack.  An attack hits on results of 1 or more, even if damage is reduced to 0, for the purpose of Status effects.
    </p>

    <p><b>Status effects:</b> Conditions applied to characters that affect attacks, defense, damage, mobility, and other aspects of combat.</p>

    <p><b>Skills:</b> In standard (non-epic) play Skills have 5 ranks each granting an ability or passive affect.  There are built in rules for players to create their own skills for full adaptability to character concepts.  Game Masters are responsible for balancing to their own games.

    <p><b>Socializing:</b> Social actions use MP and can be used to target other character's resource pools.  For example intimidation can be used to target another characters SP, and inspire regenerates SP.  In combat 1 AP is used for such actions with a limit of one per round. (Work in progress)
