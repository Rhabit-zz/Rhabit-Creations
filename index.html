      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>My name is Brandon Lirette, nickname RHabit (Repetitive Habits).  I design systems and worlds with immersive mechanics, tactical combat systems, and world-scale lore rooted in ecosystem logic and magical divergence.</p>

      <p>My philosophy: <br><br>
      Game Design: Balance is key.  If the challenge is too low the game is boring.  Too high: frustrating.  Also, don't tell players what to be, instead provide options with a lot of room for expansion, especially for people like myself who are willing to put in a bit of work to create their own vision.  I prefer building blocks over pre-built development paths.  That said, I also understand not every player wants to build everything, so I also like to produce usable ready to play examples.
      <br><br>
      World building:  People need something they can relate to in order to be immersive, and diversity is a key pillar.  Worlds evolve around character choices and documenting a world is an extensive process that provides as many options as possible while avoiding railroading. </p>
